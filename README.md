R package with supporting routines for the SCAN2 pipeline.  These routines
may not be particularly useful when separate from the main pipeline.

See https://github.com/parklab/SCAN2 for the full pipeline.


IMPORTANT: this package requires command line access to pipes (|), gunzip
and tabix. It is tested on Linux systems and is unlikely to work on other
OSes.
