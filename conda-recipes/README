SigProfiler package suite
-------------------------
The SigProfiler package and its suite of accompanying tools are not present on conda.
However, since all of these packages are installable via pip/PyPI, it is straightforward
to roll our own packages and provide them on the jluquette channel.


The only use of SigProfiler in r-scan2 is to annotate indels with ID83 signature channels.
Using SigProfiler is good to ensure compatability with published signature studies and
with COSMIC. However, it is a significant pain to do so: managing these conda packages
is not ideal and the actual R usage of SigProfilerMatrixGenerator is slow (it uses
foreign function calls to python via reticulate) and tedious (its output is written to
temporary files in /tmp and must be read back in, which can cause out of disk space
errors, temp files must be actively managed when multi-threading, etc.).

We are currently working to replicate SigProfilerMatrixGenerator's ID83 signature
channel assignment using a pure R implementation.  When complete, all SigProfiler-suite
requirements will be removed from this R package.



Conda environment for build
---------------------------

A conda environment specifically for building these recipes was created using
a fresh install of miniconda3 (v4.12.0, py38) with these extra packages installed
in this order:
    - conda install conda-build
    - conda install -c conda-forge grayskull   # this updates several packages to conda-forge versions
    - conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda anaconda-client  # for anaconda upload
    - mamba (and boa? for mamba-build?)

Note for author's personal installation: miniconda3_for_building (NOT conda3_for_building)
